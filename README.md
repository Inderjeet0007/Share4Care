We can't help everyone but everyone can help someone !!!

The act of continuous charity will benefit a person even after his/her death!!!

This is the medium for doing good to others.

In this system the user going to donate the amount of money,clothes,stationary,toys to NGO and NGO is going to place the demand of how many things it needed so our system is going to collect stuff from donar and  give it to the NGO .

In the system we have 3 modules USER, ADMIN & NGO. Each have thier own login and registration, while USER can register online by the website but NGO and ADMIN are registered offline by us. 

NGO are first checked and verfied by our team then after confirmation the registeration is successfully completed.They can login using and NGO portal on our site. 

After loging in they can request for a perticular thing they need and with quantity specification of their need. Then the need is sent to admin who checks and maintains no. of donations and no. of submissions in a table format.

Admin checks if the need of the NGO can be satisfied by resources we have if so he allots it to them and the system substracts it from the database and update the existing no. of resources.

Each time the user donates the resources table gets updated by the system when the donation reaches our center.
